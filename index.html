  <div style="border-style:solid; font-size: larger; border-color: rgba(245, 151, 9, 0.779); border-width: 9px; border-radius: 5px ;">
    <p>It is a hypothesis stating that transistor densities on a single chip will double every two years (nearly 18 months).
    The theory was named after Gordon Moore; who was the inventor of the theory in 1965.
    Then, he co-founded Intel Corporation; and this hypothesis became very important in the semiconductor technology revolution.
    Several scientists claim that Moore's law is already dead, while others think the opposite.</p>

  <h2>Hardware vs Software</h2>
  <div style="border-style:solid; font-size: larger; border-color: rgba(245, 151, 9, 0.779); border-width: 9px; border-radius: 5px ;">
    <p>Hardware is any machinery that assists in the input, processing, storage, and output activities
    of an information system. It includes physical parts of the computer such as monitor, keyboard,
    graphic card, sound card, motherboard.
    Motherboard is called the backbone of the computer because it connects all of its components.
    Software consists of computer programs that control the workings of computer hardware.
    Another definition of software: it is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell 
    the computer how to work.
