   <h1>Website Design Assignment</h1>
    <h2>Information about the project</h2>
    <p>In this project, we had to come together with our team members with the aim of building a team website from scratch.
        In order to do that, each member had to complete Javascript, CSS, and HTML courses before starting to build the website.
        After that stage, each team member had to create a Github account; and join the assigned groups. Then, as a Team 04, 
        we successfully completed all these stages and, in the end, jumped into the creation of this website.
        Finally, we hope you enjoyed our website.
        For any further concerns and feedback, please, feel free to share your thoughts with us.
      <br><br> <bold>Hope you all the best!
           Best regards, InfoLine team
